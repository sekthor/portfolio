- **Spell Book Cards** are never available to order.
  Apparently authorized licensed parties can not print enough to meet demand.
  And there is no official card pdf to print at home. 
  Luckily, there are spell collections online where you can generate spell card pdfs.
  My favorite is [aidedd.org](https://www.aidedd.org/spell/) ([5e 2014](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/spells-5e.php), [5e 2024](https://www.aidedd.org/spell/) spells.
  Another one I found for 5e 2014 spells is [hardcodex.ru](https://hardcodex.ru/), but it is a lot simpler.
