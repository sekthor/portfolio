I am sekthor.
I am a DevOps engineer, programmer and technology enthusiast.
I consider myself to be cloud native but also tend to escape into the real world from time to time.

Most of my interests follow a general theme of minimal footprints. 
I care very deeply about sustainablilty, optimization and efficency.
