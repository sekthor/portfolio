This is a curated list of cool ressources on the web, that I recommend.

- [**wiby.me**](https://wiby.me) the search engine for the classic web. 
  This is one of the coolest, nostalgia-invoking websites out there.
  You can spend hours just clicking the [*surprise me*](https://wiby.me/surprise) button and stumble upon cool personal websites.
  Really takes you back.
- [**crt.sh**](https://crt.sh) list issued certificates for a given domain.
- [**permacomputing.net**](https://permacomputing.net/) is fully dedicated to the permacomputing concept.
  It is about minimal, sustainable and durable computing.
- [**archive.org**](https://archive.org) and the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) doing the important work of preserving history.
