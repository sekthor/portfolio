As a fan of both Pen-and-Paper Games and DIY I have recently decided to try an manufacture my own dice.
I must admit I can be a bit of a [buyhard](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BuyHard) sometimes.
After little more than a year of discovering this hobby, I have already accumulated a hand full of dice sets.
I know that dice hoarding is a common illness among players (*"dice goblins"*), but I won't allow this to get out of hand.
Well, at least not with purchasing dice.
The guy equivalent to girl-math is that something is free if you make it yourself, even if the materials and time you needed to make the thing cost you *n*-fold the retail price.

Without building it up too much, this is what the final dice turned out like.
I was not expecting the first ever batch to be perfect and they are far from that.
There are a lot of blemishes and there are certain faces that are so covered in bubbles that one can barely make out the number.
But overall I am quite happy with it.
The first pour was a learning experience just to get a feel for how mold and material behave and to gather ideas on how to optimize the process

## Making the Dice

I bought a cheap silicon mold on the internet.
When It arrived, I was pleasantly surprised, as the quality was better than what I was expecting from a product that I paid next to no money for.

![mold](mold.webp)

I bought a mold that has 9 dice shapes.
Those consist of the regular 7 polyhedral dice needed in most TTRPG games as well as two additional d4 shapes.

### Resin Casting

![resin](resin.webp)

I got myself some epoxy resin from the hardware store, along with red epoxy dye.
Pictured are left to right, the resin, the hardener and the red dye.

I did not want to think about the first pour too hard and just go for it.
A project like this I am expecting to go wrong on the first couple of attempts and then learning from that mistakes.
So I was not concerned about getting the first attempt as perfect as I could but fully embracing that it was going to go bad somewhere.
So I leapt in head first to see, what my first mistake would be.

![first pour](first-pour.webp)

So I mixed the resin, hardener and dye according to the instructions and started pouring.
Once filled, the whole attempt made quite a decent first impression.
I did notice some minor air bubbles (also visible in picture), but that not concerned about it on the first pour.

When I put the lid on, I realized, that this was probably the most difficult step to master.
Meaning, that I would have to figure out a way to put it on, without creating air pockets on the top face.
Well this is exactly what happened.
I removed the lid, after seeing some quite noticeable bubbles.
I filled some extra material back into the dice, to compensate for the little amount that spilled over each hole and carefully put the lid back on.

Now I had a lot more excess material, that was pushed out of the mold and in between mold and lid.
I pressed the lid harder onto the mold in an attempt to push the excess epoxy out.
But there was still a visible layer between.

Now the most difficult part:
Patiently waiting for 48 to 72 hours, without touching mold or in any way interfering with the hardening process.
Obviously I failed that.
I touched the mould every couple of hours.
Lifted it, turned it, tried to see what was happening inside.

### Demolding the Dice

![unpainted](unpainted.webp)

After (almost) 48h I could not wait anymore and checked on my dice.
And well, they were far from perfect.
But that was expected.
The top sides is where are the bubbles have risen to.
But surprisingly, the lower sides were almost perfect.

![Bubbles in flawed dice](bad-side.webp)

The mold has a lid, that is supposed to fit snug on top of it.
Yet it only will, if there is no "spillage" from the mold itself.
As I poured the resin slightly above edge to make sure there isn't too little resin in each die cast, there was some spillover.
It hardened to a layer of about 0.1 - 0.3mm.
While not significant, technically, this raises the top sides, making that face slightly smaller and the die unfair.
I don't think this small of a difference has a meaningful impact on the entropy of the dice, but I want to try to reduce it on subsequent castings.

### Painting the numbers

I painted the numbers with the finest brush I had (000) and used standard art supply acrylic paint.
Since it is quite viscous, I mixed it with some water.
My idea was to get it "runny" enough, that I did not really have to paint the numbers, but can just apply paint into the groves and have the paint distribute itself.
However when I diluted it enough to do that, there was hardly any paint applied.
Also the surface tension of the water-paint mixture would often refuse to fill tight corners.
So I had to put it there with my brush.

This makes me consider, getting better paint.
Probably something meant to paint miniatures would do great for this.

## Conclusions

I am quite happy with the result, but there are still a lot of flaws in the dice.
For the next castings, I will consider:

- Stirring the resin more carefully to minimize bubbles
- Vibrating the resin to get the bubbles out before pouring
- Pouring the mold very slowly to prevent new bubbles
- Filling the mold completely, but with as little excess material as I can
- Vibrating the mold after pouring
- Putting the lid onto the mold from the center out to the edges to prevent trapping air.
